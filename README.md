# Battleships
Implemented the classic Battleship game running in the Linux terminal. <br />
Featuring a graphic user interface, complete with ASCII art making full use of the NCurses library. <br />
<br />
Run with: ./battleships input1.txt input2.txt input3.txt <br />
Feel free to create your own maps.
<br />
P.S. I wrote this when I first started with C and so the entire project can be rewritten in a better way.
